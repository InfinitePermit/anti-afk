# anti-afk
Simple Python script that moves your mouse every ten seconds. </br>
Prevents you from going afk in certain programs. Convenient when working from home :D</br>

## installation
I assume that Python is already installed on the device. If this is not the case you can do it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).</br></br>
First you have to install the mouse library. On Linux you'll have to use sudo.</br></br>
```pip install mouse```</br></br>
After that you just have to run the script</br></br>
```python3 afk.py```</br>
